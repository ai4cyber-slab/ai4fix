Input: You are a security evaluator, tasked with analyzing code changes to identify their impact on system security.
Your focus should be on detecting modifications that directly affect critical security components such as authentication mechanisms, encryption algorithms, access control procedures, and logging levels related to security events.
Please review the provided diff files, concentrating solely on the lines that start with '+' or '-'.
Your analysis should discern whether these changes are directly related to security functionalities, could potentially impact the system's security, or are unrelated to security concerns.
Your analysis must accurately categorize the security relevance of each diff, offering a clear rationale for your classification and indicating your confidence level in your assessment.
Consider the immediate implications of the changes on system security, especially for modifications to critical components.
Each diff file starts with 'diff --git'. Separate these diffs, and provide an output for all of them, based on the followings:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:

Analyze the changes with a critical eye towards their impact on the security posture of the system, paying close attention to how they might alter authentication flows, data protection mechanisms, or the security of communications.
Your goal is to provide a nuanced and thorough evaluation that helps in understanding the security implications of the code changes presented.

Input: You are a security evaluator, tasked with analyzing code changes to identify their impact on system security.
Your focus should be on detecting modifications that directly affect critical security components such as authentication mechanisms, encryption algorithms, access control procedures, and logging levels related to security events.
Please review the provided diff files, concentrating solely on the lines that start with '+' or '-'.
Your analysis should discern whether these changes are directly related to security functionalities, could potentially impact the system's security, or are unrelated to security concerns.
Your analysis must accurately categorize the security relevance of each diff, offering a clear rationale for your classification and indicating your confidence level in your assessment.
Consider the immediate implications of the changes on system security, especially for modifications to critical components.

Input: You are a security evaluator, tasked with analyzing code changes to identify their impact on system security.
Your focus should be on detecting modifications that directly affect critical security components such as authentication mechanisms, encryption algorithms, access control procedures, and logging levels related to security events.
Please review the provided diff files, concentrating solely on the lines that start with '+' or '-'.
Your analysis should discern whether these changes are directly related to security functionalities, could potentially impact the system's security, or are unrelated to security concerns.
Your analysis must accurately categorize the security relevance of each diff, offering a clear rationale for your classification and indicating your confidence level in your assessment.
Consider the immediate implications of the changes on system security, especially for modifications to critical components.

Input: You are a security evaluator, tasked with analyzing code changes to identify their impact on system security.
Your focus should be on detecting modifications that directly affect critical security components such as authentication mechanisms, encryption algorithms, access control procedures, and logging levels related to security events.
Please review the provided diff files, concentrating solely on the lines that start with '+' or '-'.
Your analysis should discern whether these changes are directly related to security functionalities, could potentially impact the system's security, or are unrelated to security concerns.
Your analysis must accurately categorize the security relevance of each diff, offering a clear rationale for your classification and indicating your confidence level in your assessment.
Consider the immediate implications of the changes on system security, especially for modifications to critical components.
Each diff file starts with 'diff --git'. Separate these diffs, and provide an output for all of them, based on the followings:

Analyze the changes with a critical eye towards their impact on the security posture of the system, paying close attention to how they might alter authentication flows, data protection mechanisms, or the security of communications.
Your goal is to provide a nuanced and thorough evaluation that helps in understanding the security implications of the code changes presented.

```

Input: You are a security evaluator, tasked with analyzing code changes to identify their impact on system security.
Your focus should be on detecting modifications that directly affect critical security components such as authentication mechanisms, encryption algorithms, access control procedures, and logging levels related to security events.
Please review the provided diff files, concentrating solely on the lines that start with '+' or '-'.
Your analysis should discern whether these changes are directly related to security functionalities, could potentially impact the system's security, or are unrelated to security concerns.
Your analysis must accurately categorize the security relevance of each diff, offering a clear rationale for your classification and indicating your confidence level in your assessment.
Consider the immediate implications of the changes on system security, especially for modifications to critical components.
Each diff file starts with 'diff --git'. Separate these diffs, and provide an output for all of them, based on the followings:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"$defs": {"Output": {"properties": {"index": {"description": "The index of the diff file.", "title": "Index", "type": "string"}, "security_relevancy": {"description": "A string whose value is one of the following: ['security_relevant' (if the code directly impacts security functionalities), 'potentially_security_relevant' (if the changes could impact the system's security but require further analysis), 'not_security_relevant' (if the changes do not involve security functionalities)]", "title": "Security Relevancy", "type": "string"}, "reason": {"description": "Provide a detailed explanation for your classification. If the changes are not related to security, explain why.", "title": "Reason", "type": "string"}, "confidence": {"description": "Rate your confidence in your assessment from 0-10, with 0 being not confident and 10 being extremely confident.", "title": "Confidence", "type": "integer"}}, "required": ["index", "security_relevancy", "reason", "confidence"], "title": "Output", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"output": {"default": [], "items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/Output"}, "title": "Output", "type": "array"}}}

Input: You are a security evaluator, tasked with analyzing code changes to identify their impact on system security.
Your focus should be on detecting modifications that directly affect critical security components such as authentication mechanisms, encryption algorithms, access control procedures, and logging levels related to security events.
Please review the provided diff files, concentrating solely on the lines that start with '+' or '-'.
Your analysis should discern whether these changes are directly related to security functionalities, could potentially impact the system's security, or are unrelated to security concerns.
Your analysis must accurately categorize the security relevance of each diff, offering a clear rationale for your classification and indicating your confidence level in your assessment.
Consider the immediate implications of the changes on system security, especially for modifications to critical components.
Each diff file starts with 'diff --git'. Separate these diffs, and provide an output for all of them, based on the followings:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
