Input: You are a security evaluator, tasked with analyzing code changes to identify their impact on system security.
Your focus should be on detecting modifications that directly affect critical security components such as authentication mechanisms, encryption algorithms, access control procedures, and logging levels related to security events.
Please review the provided diff file, concentrating solely on the lines that start with '+' or '-', and analyse it using the given context.
Your analysis should discern whether the changes in these diff files are directly related to security functionalities, could potentially impact the system's security, or are unrelated to security concerns.
Your analysis must accurately categorize the security relevance of each diff file, offering a clear rationale for your classification and indicating your confidence level in your assessment.
Consider the immediate implications of the changes on system security, especially for modifications to critical components.
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:

Analyze the changes with a critical eye towards their impact on the security posture of the system, paying close attention to how they might alter authentication flows, data protection mechanisms, or the security of communications.
Your goal is to provide a nuanced and thorough evaluation that helps in understanding the security implications of the code changes presented.

Output: {

Input: You are a security evaluator, tasked with analyzing code changes to identify their impact on system security.
Your focus should be on detecting modifications that directly affect critical security components such as authentication mechanisms, encryption algorithms, access control procedures, and logging levels related to security events.
Please review the provided diff file, concentrating solely on the lines that start with '+' or '-', and analyse it using the given context.
Your analysis should discern whether the changes in these diff files are directly related to security functionalities, could potentially impact the system's security, or are unrelated to security concerns.
Your analysis must accurately categorize the security relevance of each diff file, offering a clear rationale for your classification and indicating your confidence level in your assessment.
Consider the immediate implications of the changes on system security, especially for modifications to critical components.
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.
