storm+struts,448+252,gpt-4o,1,interface,not,security,FP,"The newly added interface `SessionAware` provides a mechanism for actions to access and manipulate the user's HTTP session attributes. This can have significant security implications, as improper handling of session data can lead to vulnerabilities such as session fixation, session hijacking, and unauthorized access to sensitive information. The interface allows for the storage and retrieval of session attributes, which are critical components in maintaining user state and security context. Therefore, any changes or additions related to session management are inherently security-relevant. "
