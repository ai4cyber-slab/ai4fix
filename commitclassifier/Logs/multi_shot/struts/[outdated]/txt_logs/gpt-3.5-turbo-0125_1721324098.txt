This commit adds a new file 'ServletResponseAware.java' to the 'org.apache.struts2.action' package. The file defines an interface 'ServletResponseAware' that requires implementing classes to have access to the servlet response object. The interface includes a method 'withServletResponse' that takes an HTTP response object as a parameter.
```

Important that testing is a costly operation.
Determine the answer considering the immediate implications of the changes on system security, especially for modifications to critical components.

Output 2: {
    "worth_to_re_run": "yes",
    "reason": "The addition of a new file 'ServletResponseAware.java' to the 'org.apache.struts2.action' package, which defines an interface requiring access to the servlet response object, could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities if not implemented correctly. It is crucial to re-run security testing to ensure that the new interface and method do not compromise system security.",

The previously provided diff file has already been run for security testing.
Based on your description of the commit diff file, is it worth re-running the security testing on this same file?

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Output 1: {

}

Input 2:

The previously provided diff file has already been run for security testing.
Based on your description of the commit diff file, is it worth re-running the security testing on this same file?

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"worth_to_re_run": {"description": "A string whose value is one of the following: ['yes' (if re-running the security tests on the given diff file is necessary), 'no' (if re-running the security tests on the given diff file is not worth it)].", "title": "Worth To Re Run", "type": "string"}, "reason": {"description": "Provide a detailed explanation for your answer.

```

Description:
```
Added a new test method testActionParametersAware() in the ServletConfigInterceptorTest class to test the ParametersAware interface implementation.
```

Important that testing is a costly operation.
Determine the answer considering the immediate implications of the changes on system security, especially for modifications to critical components.

Output 2: {
    "worth_to_re_run": "no",
    "reason": "Based on the description provided, the changes made in the commit do not seem to directly impact system security. The addition of a new test method for interface implementation does not pose a significant security risk that would warrant re-running the security tests.",
    "confidence": 7

The previously provided diff file has already been run for security testing.
Based on your description of the commit diff file, is it worth re-running the security testing on this same file?

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Description:
```
Added a new test method testActionServiceAware in OsgiInterceptorTest.java file to test the functionality of ActionServiceAware interface implementation in OsgiInterceptor class.

Output 2: {
